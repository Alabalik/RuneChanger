## Translating
Right now translation is done through [Zanata](https://translate.zanata.org/project/view/runechanger). Feel free to translate this project into your language.

## How it works
RuneChanger uses internal LoL client API. If it finds active session it gets rune pages for currently selected champion and displays option to set those runes to active rune page.

All new elements withing client window are actually a completely separate window which tracks client position and size to be exactly where it should be.
